# Automated SWOT Analysis from Business News

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **semantic similarity** to automatically categorize business news articles into SWOT categories â€” **Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats** â€” and generate contextual summaries using a simple web interface.

Developed as part of *IDS 572 â€“ Deep Learning & Modern Applications* at the University of Illinois Chicago.
Dataset coverage: 2013 to early 2018 | Source: *All the News 1.0*

## Key Features

- Clean and preprocess large-scale business news data
- Generate semantic embeddings using `SentenceTransformer`
- Classify content into SWOT buckets using cosine similarity
- Generate keyword-driven, category-wise summaries
- Interactive Flask web app for querying insights
- EDA visualizations to explore publication trends and content themes

## Project Objectives

In an era of information overload, this project sets out to transform business news into strategic intelligence. Here's what we set out to do:
 - Turn unstructured news into structure, by building a fully automated pipeline that reads, cleans, and prepares raw news articles for analysis.
 - Make machines think like strategists by using transformer-based NLP models to understand language and group insights into SWOT quadrants: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.
 - Match meaning, not just words, by computing semantic similarity between articles and curated keyword profiles, sentence by sentence.
 - Cut through the noise with summarization logic that distills large volumes of text into sharp, category-wise takeaways.
 - Bring it to life on the web via a Flask-powered interface that lets users explore, filter, and extract insight in real-time.
 - Visualize the unseen through exploratory data analysis that surfaces trends in content, category distribution, and publishing patterns.
